 * // For polite messages that shouldn't interrupt what screen readers are currently announcing.
 * speak( 'The message you want to send to the ARIA live region' );
 *
 * // For assertive messages that should interrupt what screen readers are currently announcing.
 * speak( 'The message you want to send to the ARIA live region', 'assertive' );
 * ```
